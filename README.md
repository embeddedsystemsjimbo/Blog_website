# Blog_website
The “Blog website” is built using Python and the Flask framework. It is styled using the Bootstrap API with webforms created using the WTforms library. The text editor used to input new post is created using the CKeditor library. Information is secured using hash functions provided by the Werkzeug library. The backend database is created using SQLalchemy (ORM) API and hosted online with herokuapp.com (See Figure 1 for sample).
